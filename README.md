### Including:
- Wheel turning/ animations
- Smoke
- Trails (tire skids)
- Impact effects

*and collision detection!*
*and additional acceleration and deceleration scripting*
*and some primitive cubes and barriers*
### *And a free car model!*

### Before playing project, and to clear up any errors, install the following from the Package Manager..

### Cinemachine
![Package Manager > Cinemachine](https://github.com/SpawnCampGames/ArcadeCarController/blob/main/readme/cinemachine.png)
and
### Post processing
![Package Manager > PostProcessing](https://github.com/SpawnCampGames/ArcadeCarController/blob/main/readme/postprocessing.png)

...both used in the Project.

### Setup

- Can be unzipped and opened as a new project or
- Can be downloaded and imported as a custom package 
with the .unityPackage..

***if opening as a new project, 
remove the .unityPackage from your project folder, 
before opening through the Unity Hub to avoid any errors***

In either case, if the project's layer's are missing:

- The ground is on the ground layer. (assign the whats ground variable on the car script)
- The car collider goes on the car layer.
- The Motor sphere goes on the motor layer.

and in physics settings we want these collisions, or lack of..
