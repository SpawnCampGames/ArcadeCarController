![Package Manager > Cinemachine](https://github.com/SpawnCampGames/ArcadeCarController/blob/main/readme/cinemachine.png)
and
### Post processing
![Package Manager > PostProcessing](https://github.com/SpawnCampGames/ArcadeCarController/blob/main/readme/postprocessing.png)

...are both used in the Project.

- can be unzipped and opened as a new project or
- you can download and import the .unityPackage..

In either case, if the project's layer's are missing

![Layers](https://github.com/SpawnCampGames/ArcadeCarController/blob/main/readme/tags.png)

- The ground is on the ground layer. (assign the whats ground variable on the car script)
- The car collider goes on the car layer.
- The Motor sphere goes on the motor layer.

and in the project settings we want these collisions..
